class LocalNoiseModel(_ImplicitOpModel):
    """
    A n-qubit implicit model that allows for only local noise.

    This model holds as building blocks individual noisy gates
    which are trivially embedded into circuit layers as requested.

    Parameters
    ----------
    num_qubits : int
        The total number of qubits.

    gatedict : dict
        A dictionary (an `OrderedDict` if you care about insertion order) that
        associates with gate names (e.g. `"Gx"`) :class:`LinearOperator`,
        `numpy.ndarray` objects. When the objects may act on fewer than the total
        number of qubits (determined by their dimension/shape) then they are
        repeatedly embedded into `num_qubits`-qubit gates as specified by `availability`.
        While the keys of this dictionary are usually string-type gate *names*,
        labels that include target qubits, e.g. `("Gx",0)`, may be used to
        override the default behavior of embedding a reference or a copy of
        the gate associated with the same label minus the target qubits
        (e.g. `"Gx"`).  Furthermore, :class:`OpFactory` objects may be used
        in place of `LinearOperator` objects to allow the evaluation of labels
        with arguments.

    prep_layers : None or operator or dict or list
        The state preparateion operations as n-qubit layer operations.  If
        `None`, then no state preparations will be present in the created model.
        If a dict, then the keys are labels and the values are layer operators.
        If a list, then the elements are layer operators and the labels will be
        assigned as "rhoX" where X is an integer starting at 0.  If a single
        layer operation is given, then this is used as the sole prep and is
        assigned the label "rho0".

    povm_layers : None or operator or dict or list
        The state preparateion operations as n-qubit layer operations.  If
        `None`, then no POVMS will be present in the created model.  If a dict,
        then the keys are labels and the values are layer operators.  If a list,
        then the elements are layer operators and the labels will be assigned as
        "MX" where X is an integer starting at 0.  If a single layer operation
        is given, then this is used as the sole POVM and is assigned the label
        "Mdefault".

    availability : dict, optional
        A dictionary whose keys are the same gate names as in
        `gatedict` and whose values are lists of qubit-label-tuples.  Each
        qubit-label-tuple must have length equal to the number of qubits
        the corresponding gate acts upon, and causes that gate to be
        embedded to act on the specified qubits.  For example,
        `{ 'Gx': [(0,),(1,),(2,)], 'Gcnot': [(0,1),(1,2)] }` would cause
        the `1-qubit `'Gx'`-gate to be embedded three times, acting on qubits
        0, 1, and 2, and the 2-qubit `'Gcnot'`-gate to be embedded twice,
        acting on qubits 0 & 1 and 1 & 2.  Instead of a list of tuples,
        values of `availability` may take the special values:

        - `"all-permutations"` and `"all-combinations"` equate to all possible
        permutations and combinations of the appropriate number of qubit labels
        (deterined by the gate's dimension).
        - `"all-edges"` equates to all the vertices, for 1Q gates, and all the
        edges, for 2Q gates of the geometry.
        - `"arbitrary"` or `"*"` means that the corresponding gate can be placed
        on any target qubits via an :class:`EmbeddingOpFactory` (uses less
        memory but slower than `"all-permutations"`.

        If a gate name (a key of `gatedict`) is not present in `availability`,
        the default is `"all-edges"`.

    qubit_labels : tuple, optional
        The circuit-line labels for each of the qubits, which can be integers
        and/or strings.  Must be of length `num_qubits`.  If None, then the
        integers from 0 to `num_qubits-1` are used.

    geometry : {"line","ring","grid","torus"} or QubitGraph
        The type of connectivity among the qubits, specifying a
        graph used to define neighbor relationships.  Alternatively,
        a :class:`QubitGraph` object with node labels equal to
        `qubit_labels` may be passed directly.

    evotype : {"densitymx","statevec","stabilizer","svterm","cterm"}
        The evolution type.

    simulator : ForwardSimulator or {"auto", "matrix", "map"}
        The circuit simulator used to compute any
        requested probabilities, e.g. from :method:`probs` or
        :method:`bulk_probs`.  The default value of `"auto"` automatically
        selects the simulation type, and is usually what you want. Other
        special allowed values are:

        - "matrix" : op_matrix-op_matrix products are computed and
          cached to get composite gates which can then quickly simulate
          a circuit for any preparation and outcome.  High memory demand;
          best for a small number of (1 or 2) qubits.
        - "map" : op_matrix-state_vector products are repeatedly computed
          to simulate circuits.  Slower for a small number of qubits, but
          faster and more memory efficient for higher numbers of qubits (3+).

    on_construction_error : {'raise','warn',ignore'}
        What to do when the conversion from a value in `gatedict` to a
        :class:`LinearOperator` of the type given by `parameterization` fails.
        Usually you'll want to `"raise"` the error.  In some cases,
        for example when converting as many gates as you can into
        `parameterization="clifford"` gates, `"warn"` or even `"ignore"`
        may be useful.

    independent_gates : bool, optional
        Whether gates are allowed independent local noise or not.  If False,
        then all gates with the same name (e.g. "Gx") will have the *same*
        (local) noise (e.g. an overrotation by 1 degree), and the
        `operation_bks['gates']` dictionary contains a single key per gate
        name.  If True, then gates with the same name acting on different
        qubits may have different local noise, and so the
        `operation_bks['gates']` dictionary contains a key for each gate
         available gate placement.

    ensure_composed_gates : bool, optional
        If True then the elements of the `operation_bks['gates']` will always
        be either :class:`ComposedDenseOp` (with a "matrix" forward simulator) or
        :class:`ComposedOp` (othewise) objects.  The purpose of this is to
        facilitate modifying the gate operations after the model is created.
        If False, then the appropriately parameterized gate objects (often
        dense gates) are used directly.

    global_idle : LinearOperator, optional
        A global idle operation, which is performed once at the beginning
        of every circuit layer.  If `None`, no such operation is performed.
        If a 1-qubit operator is given and `num_qubits > 1` the global idle
        is the parallel application of this operator on each qubit line.
        Otherwise the given operator must act on all `num_qubits` qubits.

        """
        Creates a n-qubit model, usually of ideal gates, that is capable of describing "local noise".

        By "local noise" we mean noise/error that only acts on the
        *target qubits* of a given gate.  The created model typically embeds
        the *same* gates on many different target-qubit sets, according to
        their "availability".  It also creates a perfect 0-prep and z-basis POVM.

        The gates typically specified in terms of numpy arrays that define
        their ideal "target" actions, and this constructor method converts
        those arrays into gates or SPAM elements with the paramterization
        given by `parameterization`.  When `independent_gates=False`,
        parameterization of each gate is done once, before any embedding, so
        that just a single set of parameters will exist for each
        low-dimensional gate. Thus, this function provides a quick
        and easy way to setup a model where the gates are all parameterized
        in the same way (e.g. TP-constrained).

        That said, the `custom_gates` argument allows the user to add
        almost arbitrary customization to the gates within the local-noise
        approximation (that gates *only* act nontrivially on their target
        qubits).

        For example, in a model with 4 qubits, a X(pi/2) gate on the 2nd
        qubit (which might be labelled something like `("Gx",1)`) can only
        act non-trivially on the 2nd qubit in a local noise model.  Because
        of a local noise  model's limitations, it is often used for describing
        ideal gates or very simple perturbations of them.

        Parameters
        ----------
        num_qubits : int
            The total number of qubits.

        gate_names : list
            A list of string-type gate names (e.g. `"Gx"`) either taken from
            the list of builtin "standard" gate names given above or from the
            keys of `nonstd_gate_unitaries`.  These are the typically 1- and 2-qubit
            gates that are repeatedly embedded (based on `availability`) to form
            the resulting model.  These buildin names include:

            - 'Gi' : the 1Q idle operation
            - 'Gx','Gy','Gz' : 1Q pi/2 rotations
            - 'Gxpi','Gypi','Gzpi' : 1Q pi rotations
            - 'Gh' : Hadamard
            - 'Gp' : phase
            - 'Gcphase','Gcnot','Gswap' : standard 2Q gates

        nonstd_gate_unitaries : dict, optional
            A dictionary of numpy arrays which specifies the unitary gate action
            of the gate names given by the dictionary's keys.  This is used
            to augment the standard unitaries built into pyGSTi.  As an advanced
            behavior, a unitary-matrix-returning function which takes a single
            argument - a tuple of label arguments - may be given instead of a
            single matrix to create an operation *factory* which allows
            continuously-parameterized gates.  This function must also return
            an empty/dummy unitary when `None` is given as it's argument.

        custom_gates : dict, optional
            A dictionary that associates with gate labels
            :class:`LinearOperator`, :class:`OpFactory`, or `numpy.ndarray`
            objects.  These objects describe the full action of the gate or
            primitive-layer they're labeled by (so if the model represents
            states by density matrices these objects are superoperators, not
            unitaries), and override any standard construction based on builtin
            gate names or `nonstd_gate_unitaries`.  Keys of this dictionary may
            be string-type gate *names*, which will be embedded according to
            `availability`, or labels that include target qubits,
            e.g. `("Gx",0)`, which override this default embedding behavior.
            Furthermore, :class:`OpFactory` objects may be used in place of
            `LinearOperator` objects to allow the evaluation of labels with
            arguments.

        availability : dict, optional
            A dictionary whose keys are the same gate names as in
            `gatedict` and whose values are lists of qubit-label-tuples.  Each
            qubit-label-tuple must have length equal to the number of qubits
            the corresponding gate acts upon, and causes that gate to be
            embedded to act on the specified qubits.  For example,
            `{ 'Gx': [(0,),(1,),(2,)], 'Gcnot': [(0,1),(1,2)] }` would cause
            the `1-qubit `'Gx'`-gate to be embedded three times, acting on qubits
            0, 1, and 2, and the 2-qubit `'Gcnot'`-gate to be embedded twice,
            acting on qubits 0 & 1 and 1 & 2.  Instead of a list of tuples,
            values of `availability` may take the special values:

            - `"all-permutations"` and `"all-combinations"` equate to all possible
            permutations and combinations of the appropriate number of qubit labels
            (deterined by the gate's dimension).
            - `"all-edges"` equates to all the vertices, for 1Q gates, and all the
            edges, for 2Q gates of the geometry.
            - `"arbitrary"` or `"*"` means that the corresponding gate can be placed
            on any target qubits via an :class:`EmbeddingOpFactory` (uses less
            memory but slower than `"all-permutations"`.

            If a gate name (a key of `gatedict`) is not present in `availability`,
            the default is `"all-edges"`.

        qubit_labels : tuple, optional
            The circuit-line labels for each of the qubits, which can be integers
            and/or strings.  Must be of length `num_qubits`.  If None, then the
            integers from 0 to `num_qubits-1` are used.

        geometry : {"line","ring","grid","torus"} or QubitGraph, optional
            The type of connectivity among the qubits, specifying a graph used to
            define neighbor relationships.  Alternatively, a :class:`QubitGraph`
            object with `qubit_labels` as the node labels may be passed directly.
            This argument is only used as a convenient way of specifying gate
            availability (edge connections are used for gates whose availability
            is unspecified by `availability` or whose value there is `"all-edges"`).

        parameterization : {"full", "TP", "CPTP", "H+S", "S", "static", "H+S terms",
            "H+S clifford terms", "clifford"}
            The type of parameterizaton to convert each value in `gatedict` to. See
            :method:`ExplicitOpModel.set_all_parameterizations` for more details.

        evotype : {"auto","densitymx","statevec","stabilizer","svterm","cterm"}
            The evolution type.  Often this is determined by the choice of
            `parameterization` and can be left as `"auto"`, which prefers
            `"densitymx"` (full density matrix evolution) when possible. In some
            cases, however, you may want to specify this manually.  For instance,
            if you give unitary maps instead of superoperators in `gatedict`
            you'll want to set this to `"statevec"`.

        simulator : ForwardSimulator or {"auto", "matrix", "map"}
            The circuit simulator used to compute any
            requested probabilities, e.g. from :method:`probs` or
            :method:`bulk_probs`.  Usually `"auto"` is fine, the default for
            each `evotype` is usually what you want.  Setting this to something
            else is expert-level tuning.

        on_construction_error : {'raise','warn',ignore'}
            What to do when the conversion from a value in `gatedict` to a
            :class:`LinearOperator` of the type given by `parameterization` fails.
            Usually you'll want to `"raise"` the error.  In some cases,
            for example when converting as many gates as you can into
            `parameterization="clifford"` gates, `"warn"` or even `"ignore"`
            may be useful.

        independent_gates : bool, optional
            Whether gates are allowed independent local noise or not.  If False,
            then all gates with the same name (e.g. "Gx") will have the *same*
            (local) noise (e.g. an overrotation by 1 degree), and the
            `operation_bks['gates']` dictionary contains a single key per gate
            name.  If True, then gates with the same name acting on different
            qubits may have different local noise, and so the
            `operation_bks['gates']` dictionary contains a key for each gate
             available gate placement.

        ensure_composed_gates : bool, optional
            If True then the elements of the `operation_bks['gates']` will always
            be either :class:`ComposedDenseOp` (with a "matrix" forward simulator)
            or :class:`ComposedOp` (othewise) objects.  The purpose of this is to
            facilitate modifying the gate operations after the model is created.
            If False, then the appropriately parameterized gate objects (often
            dense gates) are used directly.

        global_idle : LinearOperator, optional
            A global idle operation, which is performed once at the beginning
            of every circuit layer.  If `None`, no such operation is performed.
            If a 1-qubit operator is given and `num_qubits > 1` the global idle
            is the parallel application of this operator on each qubit line.
            Otherwise the given operator must act on all `num_qubits` qubits.

        """
        Creates a n-qubit model by embedding the *same* gates from `gatedict`
        as requested and creating a perfect 0-prep and z-basis POVM.

        The gates in `gatedict` often act on fewer (typically just 1 or 2) than
        the total `num_qubits` qubits, in which case embedded-gate objects are
        automatically (and repeatedly) created to wrap the lower-dimensional gate.
        Parameterization of each gate is done once, before any embedding, so that
        just a single set of parameters will exist for each low-dimensional gate.

        Parameters
        ----------
        num_qubits : int
            The total number of qubits.

        gatedict : dict
            A dictionary (an `OrderedDict` if you care about insertion order) that
            associates with gate names (e.g. `"Gx"`) :class:`LinearOperator`,
            `numpy.ndarray` objects. When the objects may act on fewer than the total
            number of qubits (determined by their dimension/shape) then they are
            repeatedly embedded into `num_qubits`-qubit gates as specified by `availability`.
            While the keys of this dictionary are usually string-type gate *names*,
            labels that include target qubits, e.g. `("Gx",0)`, may be used to
            override the default behavior of embedding a reference or a copy of
            the gate associated with the same label minus the target qubits
            (e.g. `"Gx"`).  Furthermore, :class:`OpFactory` objects may be used
            in place of `LinearOperator` objects to allow the evaluation of labels
            with arguments.

        prep_layers : None or operator or dict or list
            The state preparateion operations as n-qubit layer operations.  If
            `None`, then no state preparations will be present in the created model.
            If a dict, then the keys are labels and the values are layer operators.
            If a list, then the elements are layer operators and the labels will be
            assigned as "rhoX" where X is an integer starting at 0.  If a single
            layer operation is given, then this is used as the sole prep and is
            assigned the label "rho0".

        povm_layers : None or operator or dict or list
            The state preparateion operations as n-qubit layer operations.  If
            `None`, then no POVMS will be present in the created model.  If a dict,
            then the keys are labels and the values are layer operators.  If a list,
            then the elements are layer operators and the labels will be assigned as
            "MX" where X is an integer starting at 0.  If a single layer operation
            is given, then this is used as the sole POVM and is assigned the label
            "Mdefault".

        availability : dict, optional
            A dictionary whose keys are the same gate names as in
            `gatedict` and whose values are lists of qubit-label-tuples.  Each
            qubit-label-tuple must have length equal to the number of qubits
            the corresponding gate acts upon, and causes that gate to be
            embedded to act on the specified qubits.  For example,
            `{ 'Gx': [(0,),(1,),(2,)], 'Gcnot': [(0,1),(1,2)] }` would cause
            the `1-qubit `'Gx'`-gate to be embedded three times, acting on qubits
            0, 1, and 2, and the 2-qubit `'Gcnot'`-gate to be embedded twice,
            acting on qubits 0 & 1 and 1 & 2.  Instead of a list of tuples,
            values of `availability` may take the special values:

            - `"all-permutations"` and `"all-combinations"` equate to all possible
            permutations and combinations of the appropriate number of qubit labels
            (deterined by the gate's dimension).
            - `"all-edges"` equates to all the vertices, for 1Q gates, and all the
            edges, for 2Q gates of the geometry.
            - `"arbitrary"` or `"*"` means that the corresponding gate can be placed
            on any target qubits via an :class:`EmbeddingOpFactory` (uses less
            memory but slower than `"all-permutations"`.

            If a gate name (a key of `gatedict`) is not present in `availability`,
            the default is `"all-edges"`.

        qubit_labels : tuple, optional
            The circuit-line labels for each of the qubits, which can be integers
            and/or strings.  Must be of length `num_qubits`.  If None, then the
            integers from 0 to `num_qubits-1` are used.

        geometry : {"line","ring","grid","torus"} or QubitGraph
            The type of connectivity among the qubits, specifying a
            graph used to define neighbor relationships.  Alternatively,
            a :class:`QubitGraph` object with node labels equal to
            `qubit_labels` may be passed directly.

        evotype : {"densitymx","statevec","stabilizer","svterm","cterm"}
            The evolution type.

        simulator : ForwardSimulator or {"auto", "matrix", "map"}
            The circuit simulator used to compute any
            requested probabilities, e.g. from :method:`probs` or
            :method:`bulk_probs`.  The default value of `"auto"` automatically
            selects the simulation type, and is usually what you want. Other
            special allowed values are:

            - "matrix" : op_matrix-op_matrix products are computed and
              cached to get composite gates which can then quickly simulate
              a circuit for any preparation and outcome.  High memory demand;
              best for a small number of (1 or 2) qubits.
            - "map" : op_matrix-state_vector products are repeatedly computed
              to simulate circuits.  Slower for a small number of qubits, but
              faster and more memory efficient for higher numbers of qubits (3+).

        on_construction_error : {'raise','warn',ignore'}
            What to do when the conversion from a value in `gatedict` to a
            :class:`LinearOperator` of the type given by `parameterization` fails.
            Usually you'll want to `"raise"` the error.  In some cases,
            for example when converting as many gates as you can into
            `parameterization="clifford"` gates, `"warn"` or even `"ignore"`
            may be useful.

        independent_gates : bool, optional
            Whether gates are allowed independent local noise or not.  If False,
            then all gates with the same name (e.g. "Gx") will have the *same*
            (local) noise (e.g. an overrotation by 1 degree), and the
            `operation_bks['gates']` dictionary contains a single key per gate
            name.  If True, then gates with the same name acting on different
            qubits may have different local noise, and so the
            `operation_bks['gates']` dictionary contains a key for each gate
             available gate placement.

        ensure_composed_gates : bool, optional
            If True then the elements of the `operation_bks['gates']` will always
            be either :class:`ComposedDenseOp` (with a "matrix" forward simulator)
            or :class:`ComposedOp` (othewise) objects.  The purpose of this is to
            facilitate modifying the gate operations after the model is created.
            If False, then the appropriately parameterized gate objects (often
            dense gates) are used directly.

        global_idle : LinearOperator, optional
            A global idle operation, which is performed once at the beginning
            of every circuit layer.  If `None`, no such operation is performed.
            If a 1-qubit operator is given and `num_qubits > 1` the global idle
            is the parallel application of this operator on each qubit line.
            Otherwise the given operator must act on all `num_qubits` qubits.
